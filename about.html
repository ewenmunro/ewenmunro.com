              The book I carry around with me the most is The Way of Chuang Tzu

              Some quotes I ponder often:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and
                  nothingness” – Samuel Beckett
                </li>
                <li>
                  “A healthy person wants ten thousand things; a sick person
                  just wants one” – Confucius
                </li>
                <li>“We are as we see” – The Buddha</li>
                <li>“Follow your bliss” – Joseph Campbell</li>
                <li>
                  “You cannot go past what is in front of you” – my grandmother
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Nothing is more creative than death, since it is the whole
                  secret of life. It means that the past must be abandoned, that
                  the unknown cannot be avoided, that “I” cannot continue, and
                  that nothing can be ultimately fixed. When a man knows this,
                  he lives for the first time in his life. By holding his
                  breath, he loses it. By letting go he finds it.” – Alan Watts
                </li>
                <li>
                  “What is success? To laugh often and much; to win the respect
                  of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn
                  the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of
                  false friends; to appreciate the beauty; to find the best in
                  others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy
                  child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know
                  even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This
                  is to have succeeded!” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              A reflection I feel sums me up quite well: A tree that cannot
              produce fruit and whose branches are too thick and interwoven
              won’t be cut
            </li>
          </ul> -->
          <h2>Leaving Things Alone</h2>
          <p>
            I know about letting the world alone, not interfering. I do not know
            about running things. Letting things alone: so that men will not
            blow their nature out of shape! Not interfering, so that men will
            not be changed into something they are not! When men do not get
            twisted and maimed beyond recognition, when they are allowed to live
            -- the purpose of government is achieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Too much pleasure? Yang has too much influence. Too much suffering?
            Yin has too much influence. When one of these outweighs the other,
            it is as if the seasons came at the wrong times. The balance of cold
            and heat is destroyed; the body of man suffers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Too much happiness, too much unhappiness, out of due time, men are
            thrown off balance. What will they do next? Thought runs wild. No
            control. They start everything, finish nothing. Here competition
            begins, here the idea of excellence is born, and robbers appear in
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the whole world is not enough rewards for the "good," nor enough
            punishment for the "wicked." Since now the world itself is not big
            enough for reward or punishment. From the time of the Three
            Dynasties men have been running in all directions. How can they find
            time to be human?
          </p>
          <p>* * * *</p>
          <p>
            You train your eye and your vision lusts after colour. You train
            your ear, and you long for delightful sound. You delight in doing
            good, and your natural kindness is blown out of shape. You delight
            in righteousness, and you become righteous beyond all reason. You
            overdo liturgy, and you turn into a ham actor. Overdo your love of
            music, and you play corn. Love of wisdom leads to wise contriving.
            Love of knowledge leads to faultfinding. If men would stay as they
            really are, taking or leaving these eight delights would make no
            difference. But if they will not rest in their right state, the
            eight delights develop like malignant tumors. The world falls into
            confusion. Since man honour these delights, and lust after them, the
            world has gone stone-blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the delight is over, they still will not let go of it: they
            surround its memory with ritual worship, they fall on their knees to
            talk about it, play music and sing, fast and discipline themselves
            in honour of the eight delights. When the delights become a
            religion, how can you control them?”
          </p>
          <p>* * * *</p>
          <p>
            The wise man, then, when he must govern, knows how to do nothing.
            Letting things alone, he rests in his original nature. He who will
            govern will respect the governed no more than he respects himself.
            If he loves his own person enough to let it rest in its original
            truth, he will govern others without hurting them. Let him keep the
            deep drives in his own guts from going into action. Let him keep
            still, not looking, not hearing. Let him sit like a corpse, with the
            dragon power alive all around him. In complete silence, his voice
            will be like thunder. His movements will be invisible, like those of
            a spirit, but the powers of heaven will go with them. Unconcered,
            doing nothing, he will see all things grow ripe around him. Where
            will he find time to govern?
          </p>
